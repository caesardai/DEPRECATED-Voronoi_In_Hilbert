# Dynamic Voronoi Diagrams in the Hilbert Metric

A dynamic visualization software for Voronoi diagrams in the Hilbert metric on user specified convex polygons.

## Overview

In 1895, Hilbert introduced the Hilbert metric which defines a distance function on the interior of any convex body $K\subset \mathbb{RP}^d$. Hilbert geometry generalize hyperbolic geometry by adapting the Cayley-Klein model of hyperbolic geometry (on Euclidean balls) to any convex body. The Hilbert metric is a projective metric invariant under collineations of $\mathbb{RP}^d$. Hilbert geometry provides new insights into classical questions from convexity theory and the study of metric and differential geometries (such as Finsler geometries). 

Hilbert geometry is particularly valuable in the field of convex approximation. Efficient approximations of convex bodies have been used in a wide range of applications, including approximate nearest neighbor searching both in Euclidean space and more general metrics, optimal construction of ε-kernels, solving the closest vector problem approximately, and computing approximating polytopes with low combinatorial complexity. These works all share one thing in common  they approximate a convex body by covering it with elements that behave like metric balls. These covering elements go under various names: Macbeath regions, Macbeath ellipsoids, Dikin ellipsoids, and $(2,ε)$-covers. While these all behave like metric balls, the question is in what metric space? Abdelkader and Mount showed that these shapes are, up to constant factors, equivalent to Hilbert balls. Thus, a deeper understanding of geometry within the Hilbert metric can lead in a principled way to a deeper understanding of convex approximation.

As a part of the paper, we built this software to help visualize Voronoi diagrams in the Hilbert metric on user specified convex polygons.
