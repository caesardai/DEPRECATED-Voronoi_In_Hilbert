= Dynamic Voronoi Diagrams in the Hilbert Metric
A dynamic visualization software for Voronoi diagrams in the Hilbert metric on user specified convex polygons.

==Overview
The Hilbert metric is a projective metric defined on a convex body which generalizes the Cayley-Klein model of hyperbolic geometry to any convex set, and it is relevant to many other fields of study such as quantum information theory, real analysis, optimization, and network analysis. As a part of the paper (link), we built this software to visualize .
